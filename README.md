## Summary: Election-Audit
The script for this local election can easily be used for other county elections as well as any other local election or state wide election with just a few minor changes to the script.  Please note, for all the examples below as well as for any other elections this script may be used for, it is important that the proper data, as in this case, election_results.csv is provided.  To do this simply replace the "election_results.csv" file with another "csv" file with the appropriate data.  See below.
